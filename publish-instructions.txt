In order to publish, follow these steps:
1) Find the line in project.json which looks like the following, and comment it out:
    "type": "platform",

2) From terminal, in the base folder, run the following commands:

dotnet restore
dotnet build -c release
dotnet publish -c release -r ubuntu.16.10-x64
dotnet publish -c release -r ubuntu.14.04-x64
dotnet publish -c release -r win7-x64
dotnet publish -c release -r win7-x86
dotnet publish -c release -r osx.10.10-x64

You may then zip up the contents of each of the /bin/netcoreapp1.1/{platform}/publish folders.
